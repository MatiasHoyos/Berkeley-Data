I choose the variablse of assets and debt in order to find a correlation. I think that these variables are directly linked and it's why I choose them

After looking at the results I found that people with more assets tend to have a smaller debt, if any. While on the other hand people with little assets tend to have a bigger debt. This shows an inverse proportionality between assets and debt which is information that can be sued for further inevstigations and research.
